Building CCNx on OpenBSD

The c portions of CCNx should build on OpenBSD using
the generic instructions, without requiring additional
packages.  Building documentation and checking schemas
will require addition packages; refer to the readme files
for other BSD systems for hints.

CCNx for Java should work as well, but this has not been tested.
